          intertwine, there exists a plane unlike any other—a dimension born
          from the boundless depths of thought and emotion. This realm, known
          only in whispers as the Abstract, is not governed by time, matter, or
          logic. It is a canvas where imagination paints, and dreams take shape.`,
  content2: `At the heart of this mysterious expanse lies the Abstract Portal, a
          radiant, shifting gateway pulsating with energy from countless
          dimensions. It is said that the portal holds the essence of all
          creation—a nexus where the unreal becomes real, and the unseen becomes
          known. From this portal emerge the Abstract Beings, enigmatic entities
          forged from fragments of creativity, fear, ambition, and wonder.`,

  content1: `No one knows who or what created the Abstract Portal, only that it has
          always existed. It is both a gate and a sentinel, balancing the
          threads of countless worlds. From its glowing core, energy flows,
          giving birth to the Abstract Beings. These beings are more than mere
          creatures; they are manifestations of thought, shadows of ideas, and
          echoes of emotions that mortals and other entities once imagined.`,
  content2: `Each ${PROJECT_NAME} is shaped by the raw energy of the portal and the
          stories whispered into its realm. Some are serene and luminous,
          embodying hope and clarity. Others are chaotic and fractured,
          reflections of conflict and despair. Together, they are the guardians
          and keepers of balance in the Abstract, maintaining the fragile
          equilibrium between order and entropy.`,

  content1: `The Abstract Beings are no longer confined to their realm. They walk
            among us now, drawn to those who dare to imagine the impossible.
            Together, they forge a new path, one where the mortal and the
            Abstract unite to heal the shattered portal and restore balance to
            creation.`,
  content2: `But the journey is far from over. The portal still flickers, and its
            energy wanes. Whispers of an ancient prophecy speak of a
            convergence—a moment when the Abstract Portal will reveal its true
            nature and its ultimate purpose. Until then, the Abstract Beings and
            their human partners must tread carefully, for the balance is
            delicate, and the forces of chaos are always watching.`,
  content3: `Will you answer the portal’s call? Will you become a part of the
            Abstract, shaping its story and discovering its secrets? The portal
